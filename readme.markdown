#Starter Site PHP#

This is a starter site in PHP that I use as my base starting site.  It uses SlimPHP for the routing engine and Smarty for the templating engine.

## Dependencies ##

Use http://getcomposer.org to install libraries.

e.g. php composer.phar install from within the directory 'src'.
